#  [Late Again!!](https://github.com/mubin25-dodu/Late-again-)


## Introduction
"Late Again!" is a fun and engaging 2D game where players guide a university student through a jam-packed road filled with vehicles. The goal is to help the student reach his class on time. If he doesn’t make it before the timer runs out, he won’t get attendance. The game has three levels that get progressively harder as time gets shorter and the obstacles become more challenging. Players must find gaps between vehicles, think fast, and move skillfully to win.

## What Did We Implement?
We implemented a 2D game using OpenGL where:
- The player can move left, right, and jump to avoid obstacles.
- The game includes various obstacles like cars, trucks, and rickshaws.
- The game has a timer and health system.
- The game has multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- The game includes collision detection to determine if the player hits an obstacle.
- The game has a home screen, game screen, and end screens for both winning and losing scenarios.

## Why Did We Implement This?
The primary goal of this project was to apply and demonstrate our knowledge of computer graphics using OpenGL. By creating a game, we were able to explore various aspects of graphics programming, including rendering, transformations, animations, and collision detection. Additionally, this project provided an opportunity to develop problem-solving skills and creativity in designing game mechanics and user interactions.

## Significance of the Project
This project is significant because it:
- Demonstrates practical application of computer graphics concepts.
- Provides a fun and interactive way to learn and apply OpenGL.
- Encourages creativity and problem-solving in game design.
- Serves as a foundation for more complex game development projects.

## Target Population
The target population for this project includes:
- Students and educators in computer graphics and game development courses.
- Hobbyists and enthusiasts interested in learning OpenGL and game development.
- Developers looking for a simple yet engaging project to enhance their skills.

## Tools Used in the Project
- **OpenGL**: For rendering 2D graphics.
- **GLUT**: For handling window creation, input, and other utilities.
- **C++**: As the programming language for implementing the game logic.

### Example Functions
- `glTranslatef(x, y, z)`: Used to translate objects in the game world.
- `glColor3f(r, g, b)`: Used to set the color of objects.
- `glBegin(GL_QUADS) ... glEnd()`: Used to draw quadrilateral shapes.
- `glutBitmapCharacter(font, character)`: Used to render text on the screen.

## Knowledge Applied
This project applied knowledge in the following areas:
- **Computer Graphics**: Understanding of rendering, transformations, and animations.
- **Game Development**: Design and implementation of game mechanics and user interactions.
- **Programming**: Proficiency in C++ and use of libraries like OpenGL and GLUT.

## Field for Higher Study Purpose
This project serves as a stepping stone for higher studies in fields such as:
- **Advanced Computer Graphics**: Exploring more complex rendering techniques, 3D graphics, and shaders.
- **Game Development**: Developing more sophisticated games with advanced mechanics and graphics.
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Studying user interactions and improving user experience in games and applications.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Implementing AI for non-player characters and dynamic game environments.

By working on this project, students and developers can build a strong foundation in computer graphics and game development, preparing them for more advanced studies and projects in these fields.
