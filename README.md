## Introduction
**"Late Again!"** is a fun and engaging 2D game where players guide a university student through a jam-packed road filled with vehicles. The goal is to help the student reach his class on time. If [...]

## Features
- **Player Movement:** Move left, right, and jump to avoid obstacles.
- **Obstacles:** Includes various obstacles like cars, trucks, and rickshaws.
- **Timer and Health System:** The game includes a countdown timer and a health system.
- **Multiple Levels:** Three levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Collision Detection:** Determines if the player hits an obstacle.
- **Screens:** Home screen, game screen, and end screens for both winning and losing scenarios.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project was to apply and demonstrate our knowledge of computer graphics using OpenGL. By creating a game, we were able to explore various aspects of graphics programming, [...]

## Significance
This project is significant because it:
- Demonstrates practical application of computer graphics concepts.
- Provides a fun and interactive way to learn and apply OpenGL.
- Encourages creativity and problem-solving in game design.
- Serves as a foundation for more complex game development projects.

## Target Audience
- Students and educators in computer graphics and game development courses.
- Hobbyists and enthusiasts interested in learning OpenGL and game development.
- Developers looking for a simple yet engaging project to enhance their skills.

## Tools and Technologies
- **OpenGL:** For rendering 2D graphics.
- **GLUT:** For handling window creation, input, and other utilities.
- **C++:** As the programming language for implementing the game logic.

## Example Functions
- `glTranslatef(x, y, z)`: Used to translate objects in the game world.
- `glColor3f(r, g, b)`: Used to set the color of objects.
- `glBegin(GL_QUADS) ... glEnd()`: Used to draw quadrilateral shapes.
- `glutBitmapCharacter(font, character)`: Used to render text on the screen.

## Knowledge Applied
This project applied knowledge in the following areas:
- **Computer Graphics:** Understanding of rendering, transformations, and animations.
- **Game Development:** Design and implementation of game mechanics and user interactions.
- **Programming:** Proficiency in C++ and use of libraries like OpenGL and GLUT.

## Higher Study Opportunities
This project serves as a stepping stone for higher studies in fields such as:
- **Advanced Computer Graphics:** Exploring more complex rendering techniques, 3D graphics, and shaders.
- **Game Development:** Developing more sophisticated games with advanced mechanics and graphics.
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Studying user interactions and improving user experience in games and applications.
- **Artificial Intelligence:** Implementing AI for non-player characters and dynamic game environments.

By working on this project, students and developers can build a strong foundation in computer graphics and game development, preparing them for more advanced studies and projects in these fields.
