# Late-again-

"Late Again!" is a fun and simple 2D game where players guide a university student through a jam-packed road filled with vehicles. The goal is to help the boy reach his class on time. If he doesn’t make it before the timer runs out, he won’t get attendance. The game has three levels that get harder as time gets shorter and the obstacles become more challenging. Players must find gaps between vehicles, think fast, and move skillfully to win.
